# Revenue

# 1. (Competitor Models)
>Research the revenue models for competing companies. For each Customer Problem, provide a bulleted list of 10 competitor names, leveraging the previous work on Existing Solutions and Failed Solutions. Then, write a few sentences that describes the primary revenue model of each competitor, why you think that they chose their model and how you would improve their deployment of the model. Rate each revenue model deployment on a scale of 1 to 5 with 5 being best, and order the competitors from best to worst. (2 Hours)

# 2. (One Customer Problem)
>Select One Customer Problem to focus on. Leveraging your work on the Competitor Models, identify One Customer Problem that you believe will have the best long-term business prospects and greatest chance to generate significant revenue. Ensure that the One Customer Problem is a real pain or need to be faced by your target customers. Review the decision with your Working Group. Write a few sentences on why you have chosen the One Customer Problem to pursue, including any insights from your Working Group. There will be opportunities within the program to change or pivot your selected Customer Problem if necessary. (1 Hour)

# 3. (Launch Survival)
>Write one paragraph about how you will survive for 9 months while dedicating 40+ hours per week to the business without drawing any income from the business. Include your current living expenses and expenses to launch the business in your analysis. Evaluate savings, employment or consulting as income to cover your expenses. Develop a simple spreadsheet outlining your personal expenses, any anticipated business expenses, your savings and any anticipated income for 9 months (http://fndri.com/2pGs7Zr). Provide a link to the spreadsheet. (2 Hours)

# 4. (Revenue Models)
>Identify three potential revenue models that you can pursue. Write the name of the model, followed by a bulleted list of three positive and three negative aspects of each model, noting the top competitors that use each model. Based on your initial analysis, identify two of the three models to test in subsequent Revenue Interviews, and mark these models as “testing.” For each model that you are testing, write the name of the model again, and provide two price points for each model that you will test. Underneath each price point, describe how many customers that will be required to generate $100,000 in monthly recurring revenue (MRR) and describe how realistic this projection is. Consider pricing options above, below and equal to the price points of competitor offerings in the market. (3 Hours)

# 5. (Customer List)
> Create a bulleted list of target customers for each Customer Problem based on your Customer Archetype. Your Customer List can include any existing users or customers. If you are focusing on a business to business (B2B) Customer Problem, the list should include at least 3 names. If you are focusing on a consumer (B2C) Customer Problem, the Customer List should include at least 9 names. For each customer, ensure that you have their full contact details including their phone number and a couple of sentences describing their demographic information. (1 Hour)

# 6. (Revenue Interviews)
>Interview customers about the pricing of your revenue models. For B2C revenue models, secure a brief call with at least 5 customers from your Customer List. For B2B revenue models, secure a brief call with at least 2 customers from your Customer List. Before discussing the pricing, ask the customer how they would solve the Customer Problem, how much time they dedicate to the solution and how much money they spend on the solution. Then, list the two revenue models that you are considering. Ask them which model that they prefer and why. For each acceptable revenue model, outline the two price points you are evaluating, with a possibly different service for each, and get their feedback. Write the name of each target customer and a bulleted list of their feedback and include the amount that you anticipate they will actually pay over the lifetime of their commitment. Write a few sentences on how their feedback changed your pricing model. (3 Hours)

# 7. (Steps to Revenue)
>Identify all of the steps before money is deposited in your bank account. Write the name of each Revenue Model that you are considering, and then provide a numbered list of the steps that must occur before you receive a payment in your bank account from your Archetype Customer. For each step, write the name of the step, the approximate timing for the step to be completed in minutes, days or weeks, and a couple of sentences that describe what needs to happen for that step to be completed. A description of Steps to Revenue is available here (http://FI.co/guides/revenue_steps). Consider ways to dramatically reduce the number of steps or reduce the amount of time for each step. Discuss the steps that you have identified with your Working Group and write a bulleted list of the feedback received from your peers. (2 Hours)

# 8. (One Revenue Model)
>Select One Revenue Model to pursue. Examine the complexity of reaching a $100,000 MRR level and the complexity of the Steps to Revenue. Identify a Revenue Model that has the least complexity and the highest opportunity to scale based on the MRR analysis and conversations with customers. This will be your One Revenue Model. Write the name of the One Revenue Model and a couple of sentences as to why you chose it. If necessary, do further Revenue Interviews and further simplification of the Steps to Revenue, updating your previous work. (1 Hour)

# 9. (Mockup)
>Start creating a Mockup of the solution to your One Customer Problem. Research best practices to create a Mockup for your solution, which may be a mobile app, website, hardware device or process. Select a tool or set of tools to create a Mockup for your solution (See Resources). Brainstorm on the best methods to use the selected tool or tools to produce something that you can show to target customers. You may want to consider releasing a Concierge MVP, which delivers value to customer through the manual delivery of the solution rather than through automation or technology. Develop the initial Mockup that has sufficient detail to impress a target customer with the value that they will receive through the solution. Provide a bulleted list of any tools that you have chosen and one sentence on the reason for choosing the tool. Provide accessible links, photographs, drawings, processes or any other available documentation on the Mockup that you have completed. (6 Hours)

# 10. (Company Profile)
> Update each field on the ‘Edit Profile’ section of the Founder Institute site. Fill in the company information, including the five sentence company description. If you do not have a company name yet, use a temporary name for now. Ensure that each field has complete information with proper grammar and punctuation. (30 Minutes)

# 11. (Second Mailing)
> Expand The List to include at least 10 more people, including people from the Customer List. Send a second mailing to The List with an outline of your final idea, your chosen Revenue Source and a solicitation for feedback. Include three key pieces of feedback that you receive. (1 Hour)

# 12. (Pitch Deck)
>Develop a first draft of a three minute long pitch deck. Use a professional presentation template, and outline a series of slides to present your business in three minutes based on the concepts and flow that have resonated with Mentors from your Hotseat pitch, and your learning this week. For reference, check this Founder Guide on pitching (https://fi.co/guides/1071). Provide a link to the DRAFT deck. (2 Hours)

# 13. (Office Hours)
>Schedule Office Hours with at least one Director or Mentor for this week or next. Book a 15, 20 or 30 minute meeting with at least one Director or Mentor to discuss your progress, why you selected the final Customer Problem you did, your Pitch Deck, and to review any questions that you have. (30 minutes)

# 14. (Hotseat Pitch)
>Update your one minute Hotseat pitch for the One Customer Problem, taking all of the learning from this week. Practice the updated pitch at least five times. (30 Minutes)
