# Orientation
## Company-Building Work by Danial
## 1. (Founder Guide)
My takeaway from the Founder Guide is life is hard and founder has even harder life.  It has no excuses, either we do it or we don't. 

## 2. (Curriculum)
I think the curriculum of the first 4 sessions has built the foundation for my dream company. Especially, I am still in the idea stage, searching for guidance and validation.  The tougher part for me from technical background is on how to get the Vision right and target to the right customer with sound revenue model.  The first part of the programme itself is very much defined how my dream company going to be.

## 3. (Working Group)

Currently serving customers from SMEs to large enterprises from various industries. 

Currently working on Gameconomy, a Blockchain-secured game resources exchange that allow true ownership of game resources to the gamers so that they can trade it freely and securely on the exchange. Have pitched the idea to Blockchain investors Jagdish Pandya from BlockOn but unfortunately he has invested in another similar startup in US just 2 weeks before his pitching. Kin Meng also got selected to submit executive summary to VCs in Singapore via GTouch for seed funding and it is still in progress.

Kin Meng is seasonal entrepreneur, with his experience in startup, I will be learning much on the business and funding aspect of the startup.  Moreover, as we are both has the technical background, I think we can related much more easier.

## 4. (Why)
In Malaysia, healthcare costs are escalating about 10-15 percent a year is making private healthcare out of reach when you need it the most.  It is heart breaking to see people who depend on public healthcare to suffer to due sheer demand that can’t be handle by the government alone. While private healthcare is too expensive for everyone to afford it. If we don’t start doing something about, majority of the people will be not received sufficient healthcare.

I wanted to be part of the solution because I believe that everyone deceived better healthcare.  In 3-5 years’ time, while I can’t control how the medical practises should work, I can help to make the process more efficient, cutting out the non-value-added activities and serving the patient with better value.  I believed everyone should has access to both quality private and public healthcare to maximize their quality of life.

Or I can choose to do nothing, which I will continue to see the suffering of who not afford for the healthcare costs; and in next 3, 5, 10, or 20 years, some of my family, friends or even myself will experience the same predicament.

Instead of waiting for others to solve this problem, which no one know when or how. I will rather be part of the solutions instead as part of the problem.

## 7. (Time)
I am committing about 30 hours a week into the FI programme while I still having my day job.  To make it work, I am making it my routine to wake up by 2 hours earlier and 2 hours after dinner on weekday, except Tuesday, to spend it on FI for assignments, research. etc.

The morning 2 hours is the most important for me to get my thought and formulate the main points. While rest of the 2 hours is for elaboration, research, etc.  Weekend is use for putting everything together for review before submission.   

## 8. (Progress)
In initial idea conceptual stage, I am still finalizing how my idea should be, while I need to quickly decide the model whether it is B2B or B2C.  At this moment, I believe B2B is the route to be taken as it required less funding and quicker break even

## 9. (Life Story)
### Childhood
I born and growth up in Ipoh of my early life in traditional family. Moved to Kuala Lumpur at 16 years old and settled here ever since.  Growing up in a small city is a blessing as I have the opportunity to enjoy the semi-rural life that made me appreciate the nature, true person-to-person relationship, and not too obsessed of online social media.

### Schooling
I was attending Chinese school in my first 6 years of primary education, it has taught me not only Chinese as the language. It also instils value of hard working and respect as my core characters.

After moved to KL, I was enrolled in National school, Vivekananda in Brickfields. It is great experience for me to mixed and accept all other races into my daily life.  In fact, by understand other cultures, it changed me and made me who I am today.  It is the turning point that laid down the foundation of I am becoming reverted Muslim and marrying my wife who is Kelantanese Malay,

The university days has been eye opener and opened my mind for all possibility. The experience has taught me to think asking why and how, not just only what.  I have graduated with Bachelor of Business Admin with double major in Operation Management & Business Information System.   

### Professional Career
While I have business degree, my interest is in programming and problem solving. I choose to be a Software Engineer, and pursuit to Solution Architect, and then Cloud & DevOps Practitioner, who started my career in internet dotcom era at year 1999 as Java Programmer in US. 

Over the course of my career, I have played many roles such as developer, architect, technical manager, project manager and has been part of Senior Management Team at my previous employer.  I have work in various industry from Healthcare, Banking to Telco.

I have worked in Healthcare Third Party Administrator for Insurer about 10-15 years ago, and it gave me the opportunity to see how the healthcare industry is working.  It also let me see the tragedy of the uninsured or under insured patients’ predicament.

### Entrepreneurship
While working for large corporation can be rewarding, it is not fulfilling my dream.  There is always something you wanted to do to make the different and make life better for people.  As age catch up, parent is getting older, I have realized the important of quality healthcare. 

Embracing the journey of this entrepreneur is important for me as the life mission and statement. Whether it is success or failed, I can proudly tell me children that I have try to make life better for the society.

### The Future
With my all I have learned for the past 20 years in my professional career, I believe I have the necessary to build a startup. With FI programme, I believe I can build a successful startup which will change the life for people to be better.

I have the strong technical knowledge in application development and enough understanding of the business side to make this work.  My experience from multiple roles, has taught me many soft skills, from people management, stakeholder management to project management, More important, I have the vision and passion to drive it. 

## 10. (Hotseat Pitch)

I am currently developing mobile healthcare application to help optimize service values offer to patients by reducing billing administrative processes and improve payment efficiency between providers and payers.

By profession, I am software engineer, solutions architect, development manager who worked in healthcare, Telco and banking industry for the past 20 years.  10-15 years ago, I have worked for project with Maybank using credit card and card terminal as the payment and medical data transaction channel to simplify the payment process in the healthcare industry.

Healthcare cost is escalating everywhere in the world. In Malaysia, it is at average 10-15% increase annually.  One the contributing reason is the inefficiency in the billing and payment process and this non-value-added activity has directly increased the costs of healthcare. And it gets worse if you admitted hospital at oversea and needed cross border transaction.

I am determined to be part of the solutions to keep healthcare costs affordable and I believe I am the right person to do this

### 11. (Co-Founders)

My ideal co-founders should have one or more of the following:
* Medical knowledge, Medical Doctor preferred
* SME in the healthcare industry
* Sales Focus
* Most important that we able to build trust in each other
